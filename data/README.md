# Directory for Model Data

Data necessary for forward simulation are read into the operating model from the **Sablefish_Input.xlsx** workbook.
**Sablefish_Input.xlsx** is C. Cunningham's modification of the data initially provided by K. Fenske in the **data_inputsOM.xlsx** workbook. Some values have been updated from the 2017 Alaska Sablefish SAFE.
