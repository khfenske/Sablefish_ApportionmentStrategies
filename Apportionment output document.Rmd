## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#install the libraries
require(dplyr)
require(reshape2)
require(tidyverse)
require(ggplot2)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#read in the apportionment R object files

#do final analysis and plotting across apportionment types


```

# Conditioning period


# Model validation figures
## Convergence
This is the proportion of model years that converged for each simulation run, for the selected apportionment type. Convergenge is defined as the EM run in ADMB had a maximum gradient component less than 0.1.
```{r, echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
conv_num <- matrix(NA,ncol=n.sims,nrow=n.year)
#max_grads <- (format(max_grads,scientific=FALSE))
for(i in 1:n.sims){
  for(y in forproj.styr:n.year){
    if(abs(max_grads[y,i]) < 0.1) {
    conv_num[y,i] <- 1      
    } else {
      conv_num[y,i] <- 0        
    }
  }
}

temp_b <- apply(conv_num[forproj.styr:n.year,],2,sum)
(temp_b1 <- temp_b/length(forproj.styr:n.year))

#proportion of sims and years that converged
sum(temp_b)/(length(forproj.styr:n.year)*n.sims) 
```

# Performance metrics
## stability for each apportionment option (over all areas summed, and by area) - mean and median absolute change in in ABC year to year and for all years

## How well do apportionment options track true biomass? Relative percent difference in OM biomass by area vs EM apportionment by area

## For each apportionment option, what is the proportion of years*sims where EM F/F40<1?

## For each apportionment option, what is the proportion of years*sims where EM B/B40<1? What is the mean and median depletion (SSBterminal year/B40) across sims for each year from EM? (plot it)

## mean and median age at harvest from EM (all areas combined) (and roughly mapped to size)
## mean and median catch/ABC for each area and overall
